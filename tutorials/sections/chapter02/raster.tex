\subsubsectionlang{en}{Raster Formats}
\lang{en}{
	Raster image formats, often better known as pixel formats, build up the image from square pixels. It is therefore impossible to edit shapes, lines, text or any other type of the images content directly.
		Manipulating such an image after the fact is there very often much more labour intensive. On the other hand, most images found on the internet and all images exported by digital cameras are raster images.

		Ink/Stitch is only able to handle vector images. Therefore, in chapter \ref{vectorConversion} \nameref{vectorConversion} we will learn how to convert a raster image to a vector format.
		This has the added benefit of being able to manipulate the image in many ways that would be impossible or very difficult with a raster image.
