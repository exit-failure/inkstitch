	Vector images are comprised of shapes an strokes.
	This means that they usually can be scaled to pretty much every size without loosing visual quality.

	That also means that editing them may be a lot easier or a bit harder than editing images that are made out of pixels.
	In any case, if you have never worked with vector images, it may take a little bit of time to get used to it.
