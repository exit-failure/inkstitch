	It is often a good idea to resize your image to roughly the size that your finished embroidery pattern is supposed be.
	You even can set up Inkscape so that it will display images at the right size when scaling is set to 100\%. For that, go to the 'Preferences' $\rightarrow$ 'Interface'.
	Inkscape will show a ruler that you can compare to another, physical ruler. You can select the correct measurement unit for your physical ruler to the right of Inkscapes ruler. Then adjust the slider above until your and Inkscapes ruler match as exactly as possible.
	Make sure to also check the box 'Show zoom percentage corrected by factor'.

	To resize an image after importing it into Inkscape, follow these steps:
	Enable the 'Select and transform' tool by clicking on the topmost arrow in the standard too bar or by pressing 'S' on your keyboard.
	Then, click on the image you would like to resize. You can now drag one of the images corner to change the size or enter the desired dimensions in the 'W' and 'H' boxes at the top of the screen.
	To keep the aspect ratio the same as the original image hold the 'CTRL' key while dragging a corner or click the lock icon between the 'W' and 'H' boxes before entering a new size.
	You can change the measurement unit by clicking the drop down menu to the right of the 'H' box.
