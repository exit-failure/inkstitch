	To import an image into Inkscape you multiple options. Three of these are:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Directly open the image with Inkscape.
		\item Drag the image file from an file explorer window into the Inkscape window.
		\item In Inkscape click on 'File' $\rightarrow$ 'Import' and select the file you would like to import.
	\end{itemize}

	When importing an image, Inkscape might display an import dialogue which lets you select certain file format specific options.
	Usually it is sufficient to leave these options at their default values and just confirm the dialogue.
