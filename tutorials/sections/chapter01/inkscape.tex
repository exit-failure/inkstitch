The first piece of required software is Inkscape. It can be found at \url{https://inkscape.org/}. The most recent stable version at the time of writing is 1.2.2.
If your operating system is Windows, make sure to try to download and install the 64-bit version first. If the setup gives you an error directly after starting it, try the 32-bit version second.
Inkscape is available via the default repositories of almost all Linux distributions. If yours should be the exception, you can use the available Appimage or Snap Store images.
For MacOS please make sure to select the correct version for older systems with Intel or newer system with Apple M processors.
